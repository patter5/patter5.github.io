# Meetup of the Week
What: **Women Who Code**'s [DevOps Study Night: Scripting & Automation](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/250924178/) 

When: Wednesday 6/6/2018.

Getting hands-on with DevOps in a group that empowers women in tech and provides the ultimate atmosphere of inclusion â€”who could ask for more!? WWC should be winning awards, not only for its success in fulfilling its mission, but for the quality of its workshops. I can't wait for Wednesday!
