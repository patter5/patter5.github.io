# Hello to You!

Join me in my adventures breaking into the software industry as a non-trad recent
CS grad.

I've been actively looking for a great team to bring my skills and experience to
since February. While looking, I'm using my free time to explore tech that I didn't
have the opportunity to explore in school. I'm excited about all the possibilities,
and I'm really enjoying meeting people in the Portland software community at various
meetups.

## Blog Goals
I'll try to approach my observations with honesty, humility, curiosity, and inclusiveness,
but I'll also be opinionated and loud about experiences that conflict with, reinforce, or
otherwise bring attention to my values and assumptions.
