## Adding a hobby space is the best thing I did for myself and my productivity.
While I was in college, I had a professor who kept several musical instruments lying around his workspace. I always thought this was super cool, and it made his space feel very friendly.

I asked him about it. He said, "Every once-in-a-while I just play some music to clear my mind, then go back to work."

I decided to double my desk back-to-back and place an electronic keyboard across from my workspace. Now if my wheels start spinning, or if I start feeling the need for a break, I can just walk around to the other side of my desk and play for a while.

Since I've had the music space, I've noticed that my stress and fatigue has decreased significantly and my mind seems more ready to think when I need to.

I'm also becoming a better keyboard player!
