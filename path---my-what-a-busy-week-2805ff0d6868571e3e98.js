OiT is a very active community with great talks and fun socials. They also support LGBTQ communities all over the world by providing web services in areas of the world that aren\'t particularly safe for LGBT people. OiT has groups in most major cities in the US, and others across the globe.</p>\n<p>The Portland group has lots of attendees from some very big names in tech who seem to have a lot of involvement in organizing events and being very active in the OiT leadership community.</p>\n<h3 id="the-tea"><a href="#the-tea" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>The Tea</h3>\n<p>So I\'m just gonna break the Portland passive-aggressive stereotype and just serve some tea for a bit. </p>\n<p>The Portland group is made up of mostly young gay men, but I believe OiT is actively working to be more welcoming and actively inclusive of the more diverse range of Portland\'s LGBT tech community by hosting panels with Lesbian, Trans, Non-binary, and Women leaders from diverse cultural backgrounds. </p>\n<p>The criticism that I\'ve heard about the OiT socials is that circles seem to form (quite early in the night) based on status, age, gender, and looks rather than curiosity about what people are doing. This has caused many of my lesbian friends to stop attending OiT socials (I really want them to give it another shot).\nIf the group truly wishes to be more inclusive, it\'s ultimately up to the attending members to act more welcoming, inclusive, and curious at the socials by resisting the urge to self-organize into circles this way. Until this breaking of circles becomes the OiT social culture, the unintended impact may be that many people (women, older people, trans people, people of varying weights and looks) with valuable ideas might feel excluded and go elsewhere.</p>\n<p>OiT PDX is off to a good start though. The "From URL to IRL" panel talk was one of the highlights of the season for me, and the socials are definitely worth attending in spite of my criticism above.
